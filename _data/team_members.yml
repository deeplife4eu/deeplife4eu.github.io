- name: Britta Velten	
  university: Heidelberg University	
  description: Britta Velten is a tenure-track-professor for Multifactorial Data Analysis and Machine Learning in the Life Sciences at the Centre for organismal studies (COS) and the Centre for Scientific Computing (IWR) of Heidelberg University. Her group works at the interface of data science, machine learning and the life sciences with the aim to develop the computational tools and statistical methods that are required to translate large-scale molecular data sets (‘omics data’) into biological insights and novel discoveries. Trained as a mathematician, she obtained a PhD in statistics from ETH Zurich and EMBL Heidelberg. From 2019-2022 she worked as a postdoc at the German Cancer Research Center and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.
