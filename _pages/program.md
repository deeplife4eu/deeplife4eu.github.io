## Program

This course will be organized in 4 blocks over 14 weeks (start: week of 26.02.2024)

1. Basic concepts in deep learning – 4 weeks
2. DL in single-cell genomics – 3 weeks
3. DL in protein bioinformatics - 4 weeks
4. DL in image analysis – 3 weeks
<br>

The course format will comprise a weekly **90-minute online lecture** and a **weekly hybrid (in-person/online) practical Python session**. Lectures will be given by [teachers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team) from all participating universities. Lectures and practical exercises on all three application areas will be centered around one **recent publication** illustrating a specific application and method.
<br>

The course will end with a 2-day workshop and **hackathon meeting** in Heidelberg in June 2024 during which students will be able to implement a short project and listen to scientific lectures.


## Prerequisites {#Prerequisites}

Students attending this course are expected to have some basic statistics knowledge and machine-learning fundamentals. 
Recommended books are among others:

1. [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville
2. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman
3. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman (a simpler version of the previous book)

Specifically, we expect that the following concepts are familiar:

#### basic statistics 

* accuracy
* sensitivity/specificity
* area under the curve (AUC)
* probability distributions
* random variable
* expectation of a random variable

#### machine-learning

* overfitting vs. underfitting
* cross-validation
* usage of training, validation and testing datasets
* classification vs. regression (supervised vs. unsupervised)
* binary vs. multi-class classification

#### mathematical foundations

* matrix algebra
