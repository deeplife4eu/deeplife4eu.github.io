# Program

This course will be organized in 4 blocks over 14 weeks (start: week of 26.02.2024)

1. [Basic concepts in deep learning](#Part1) – 4 weeks
2. [DL in single-cell genomics](#Part2) – 3 weeks
3. [DL in protein bioinformatics](#Part3) - 4 weeks
4. [DL in image analysis](#Part4) – 3 weeks
<br>

The course format will comprise a weekly **90-minute online lecture** and a **weekly hybrid (in-person/online) practical Python session**. Lectures will be given by [teachers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team) from all participating universities. Lectures and practical exercises on all three application areas will be centered around one **recent publication** illustrating a specific application and method.
<br>

The course will end with a 2-day workshop and [hackathon meeting](#Hackathon) in Heidelberg in June 2024 during which students will be able to implement a short project and listen to scientific lectures.


### Evaluation
Evaluation will be based on a final **online exam** and the assessment of **practical exercise assignments**. Successful participants will earn 4 ECTS credits.


## Lecture Material
The [Lecture Material]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/lecture_material) for the **practical sessions** can be found on [Github](link to Github). The **online lectures** are uploaded on [Youtube](YT link) (pre-recorded lectures) or take place via **Zoom** (live lectures).
