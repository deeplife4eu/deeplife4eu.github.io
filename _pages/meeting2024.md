# DeepLife Hackathon - Heidelberg 14.-16.06.2024


<img src="./images/heidelberg.png" alt="drawing" width="750"/>

Our final hackathon meeting will take place in Heidelberg from **Friday, June 14th until Sunday, June 16th**!! Looking forward welcoming you in Heidelberg to finalize the projects.



### Concept

We will publish [a list of projects early May **(projects are online!!)**](./projects.html). Teams of ~4 students from one university will form and select none pf the projects to work on. Several teams for different universities will therefore work in parallel on the same projects!

During the Hackathon, the teams which have worked on the same project will work together to discuss and compare their results, and run their model on a new testing data. In addition, the teams will prepare a poster (made of 8 A4 sheets) which will be presented during the poster session on Sunday morning.

### Schedule

The Hackathon will start at 2pm on Friday, 14th in BioQuant, Room SR041. There will be signs at the entrance of the BioQuant building. Registration can be done between 1pm and 2pm at the welcome desk in BioQuant.

We will have a guest lecture by [Prof. Dr. Rebecca Wade](https://www.h-its.org/people/prof-dr-rebecca-wade/) from HITS Heidelberg on Friday night (5pm) **"Towards synergizing Molecular Simulation and Machine Learning for Structure-based Drug Design"**.
