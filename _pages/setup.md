## Google Colab
We recommend to use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/#) for practical sessions. For this, you will need a **personal Google account**. <br>
If you have problems setting up Google Colab, you can ask questions [here](https://github.com/orgs/deeplife4eu/discussions/categories/technical-questions).
