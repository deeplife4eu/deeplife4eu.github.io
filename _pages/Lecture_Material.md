### Prerequisites {#Prerequisites}

Students attending this course are expected to have some basic statistics knowledge and machine-learning fundamentals. 
Recommended books are among others:

1. [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville
2. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman
3. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman (a simpler version of the previous book)

Specifically, we expect that the following concepts are familiar:

#### basic statistics 

* accuracy
* sensitivity/specificity
* area under the curve (AUC)
* probability distributions
* random variable
* expectation of a random variable

#### machine-learning

* overfitting vs. underfitting
* cross-validation
* usage of training, validation and testing datasets
* classification vs. regression (supervised vs. unsupervised)
* binary vs. multi-class classification

#### mathematical foundations

* matrix algebra

### Online Lectures {#Online_lectures}

We will use Zoom for live online lectures, and [Youtube](link) for pre-recorded lectures. For specific details about each week, you can refer to the [Program]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/program).

### Practical Sessions {#Practical_sessions}

You can find the lecture materials for the practical sessions on [Github](https://github.com/deeplife4eu/Lecture-materials).
